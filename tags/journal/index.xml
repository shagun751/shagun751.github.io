      <title>Improvements in MLPG formulation for 3D wave interaction with fixed structures</title>

&lt;p&gt;The paper presented a detailed new 3D formulation of the solution procedure for Navier-Stokes equation for incompressible Lagrangian flow problem using MLPG. The existing MLPG_R scheme with it Petrov–Galerkin formulation using Rankine source had the significant advantage of removing gradient operations from the unknown quantity. This paper has additionally provided the derivation of a semi-analytical integration technique with a symmetric expression (MLPG_RS) and has quantified the associated error. A detailed analysis of the influence of the integration domain radius on the stability and accuracy of the solution was conducted to understand the integration method error. Based on this, we have prescribed the radius of the support domain and the integration domain.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure:&lt;/strong&gt; 3D Surface plot for velocity magnitude in the vicinity of the cylinder under the action of the steepest trough in focusing wave&lt;/h4&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A detailed algorithm was presented for coupling of 2D FNPT-FEM with the 3D MLPG_RS method. This hybrid approach was used as the wave-making condition, which limited the need for 3D domain to the vicinity of the cylinder. It allowed us to significantly reduce the 3D computational domain and number of time-steps, and has improved the overall computational efficiency of the model. A detailed analysis was done to identify the appropriate size of overlapping zone between the 2D and the 3D domain for solitary, regular and focusing waves. The paper presents minimum overlapping zone length criterion for successful coupling. We were able to use the strength of potential flow model in accurate wave-generation and propagation over long distances, due to which the wave reaching the cylinder was highly accurate and resulted in excellent agreement of numerical pressure probe signals with the experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have demonstrated the issue of mis-identification of free-surface particles in the vicinity of the cylinder with the existing scheme and have provided a simple alternative technique instead. A moving wall algorithm was presented to capture the waterline on side-wall faces. It enabled the model to capture small amplitude waves and thus made it possible to accurately replicate a focusing wave. We briefed upon the other improvements in application of rigid wall boundary condition, particle collision and redistribution. The collective result of these modifications was demonstrated through pressure probe signal comparison, highlighting the improvements in the accuracy and the stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MLPG_RS has the strength of simulating complex flows using relatively lesser number of nodes in comparison to other particle based schemes. This was demonstrated through the mesh and time-step convergence study in this paper. We highlighted the capabilities through excellent comparison of pressure for probes located outside the initial water level. We have also conducted a mesh and time-step convergence study and have demonstrated the suitable range of parameters for interaction of waves with fixed structures. This work has set the basis for further developments in MLPG towards 3D simulation of moving and floating bodies. The hybrid modelling approach will be extended to further reduce the computational domain by shifting the absorbing layer to a potential flow model. Such developments can help bring particle based schemes in the mainframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present manuscript has presented and validated a baseline laminar 3D MLPG model. The complex cases of interaction of cylinder with banded steep focusing wave helped us identify issues with the model which may be hidden under the noise of breaking waves. Therefore, with the confidence in the improvements presented in this manuscripts we will present a detailed study on breaking waves in 3D using MLPG in our future work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Demonstration of control and inspection by circumferentially guided ultrasonic waves using novel Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicle</title>

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/HxKO0T91lI4&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;Video demonstrating the control algorithm of the underwater ROV.&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video above shows the prototype underwater ROV designed for inspection of submerged pipes. Control and sensing implemented using Raspberry Pi microprocessor and Arduino microcontroller. The system is capable of live camera feed from 2 1080p cameras, IMU for navigation, pressure sensor for depth estimation and high sampling ultrasonic sensor for with generation and sensing of circumferentially guided ultrasonic pulses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ROV was hence able to meet the primary objective. The novel design of the pneumatic gripper on the ROV hull is able to grip underwater pipes with reasonable strength. The ROV demonstrated that the combination of processing power of Raspberry-Pi and Arduino Mega, along with feedback sensors like IMU and pressure sensor can be used for controlling multiple degrees of freedom of motion simultaneously and hence provide a reliable navigation to a submerged pipeline network. It can successfully hover over pipe and grip it using the pneumatic grippers. The specially tuned motion control ensures that ROV can move along a pipe’s length and take angled turns when necessary over the pipeline network. The affordable hardware has also been made to handle the large amount of data real-time from two mounted cameras for a live feed and ultrasonic probe. It has also successfully demonstrated the use of circumferential guided ultrasonic waves for detecting defects on pipeline surface.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure:&lt;/strong&gt; Side view of the ROV prototype with major parts specified.&lt;/h4&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system hence overcomes the shortcoming of pigging as it can comfortably make sharp angled turns, provide live feedback of data and can run for long periods of time as it is externally powered. Also, it does not expose the pipeline to surrounding atmosphere and thus avoids any chance of contamination and addresses the safety concerns regarding insertion and removal of a pig device. In case more processing power is required, an arrangement using multiple Raspberry-Pi or using ones with better specifications, such as Raspberry-Pi 2 with 1 GB of RAM and a 900 MHz quad core processor; would be more effective as compared to available alternatives. The same system can be modified for inspecting large tank floors too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work has presented the proof of concept of using ultrasonics for defect detection using ROVs. With this basis, the future work will investigate complex problems such as identification of the defect, use of an array of ultrasonic sensors for simultaneous analysis, etc. Additionally, this work shows the ability of the communication and electronics architecture built using affordable and readily available microprocessor and sensors to handle the large amount of data associated with simultaneous ultrasonic sensing and ROV control. This approach can be scaled for increased complexity in control and sensing.&lt;/p&gt;
