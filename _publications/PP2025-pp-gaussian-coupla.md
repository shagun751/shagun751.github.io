Offshore floating structures are experiencing harsh environmental conditions risking their safety. Therefore, mooring lines are crucial for ensuring structures' stability. Sudden increases in tensions after temporarily slack of the mooring line are called snap loads and are the most critical load states. These snap loads and their dependence to various factors are investigated in the present study. 12 study locations in the south-eastern North Sea are selected. For each location, wave and current variables are extracted from a three-dimensional large-scale numerical model covering the European Shelf. Mooring tensions at different rope positions are calculated via a Finite Element model for flexible mooring lines for different hydrodynamic conditions and used subsequently to obtain tension rates as indicator for snap loads.The dependence among 13 variables per study location is modelled via Gaussian copula-based Bayesian Networks (GCBN). This allows for spatial analysis of the relationships between hydrodynamic variables and tension rates, but also to determine the influence of hydrodynamic variables on expected tension rates. Furthermore, distributions of tension rates are obtained under specific constant hydrodynamic conditions. The results indicate that conditionalising on certain hydrodynamic variables can reduce the expected tension rates, as their marginal distributions are characterised by heavy tails. Still, mooring systems should be designed conservatively. However, once specific hydrodynamic information is available, uncertainties can be minimised, enhancing safety and reliability. Thus, accounting for the dependence among hydrodynamic variables and tension rates is crucial for improving the safety of structures under varying environmental conditions.
