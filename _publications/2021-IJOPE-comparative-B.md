In this paper, the comparative study carried out for focused wave interaction with a moving cylinder in ISOPE-2020 is reported. The fixed cylinder cases are reported in the companion paper as Part A (Sriram, Agarwal, Yan et al., 2021). The paper discusses qualitative and quantitative comparison between four different numerical solvers that participated in this comparative study. This is a challenging problem, as the cylinder moves over 40 m and interacts with the focusing waves. The performance of various solvers is compared for two different moving cylinder speeds. Both weakly coupled models and full Navier–Stokes (NS) solvers with different strategies for modeling the cylinder motion were adopted by the participants. In particular, different methods available for numerically simulating the forward speed problem emerge from this paper. The qualitative comparison based on the wave probe and pressure probe time histories between laminar and turbulent solvers is presented. Furthermore, the quantitative error analysis for individual solvers shows deviations up to 30% for moving wave probes and 50% for pressure time history. The reliability of each method is discussed based on all the wave probe and pressure probe discrepancies against experiments. The deviations for higher speed shown by all solvers indicate that further improvements in the modeling capabilities are required.
